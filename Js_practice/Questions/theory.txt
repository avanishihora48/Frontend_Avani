# Data types 

Q1: What are the different types of data types in Java?

ans :- there are two types of data types 1. primitive , 2. non-primitive

Q.2 Can you list all the primitive data types in JavaScript? 

ans:- Here are all 7 primitive data types in JavaScript:

String ("Hello")
Number (42, 3.14)
BigInt (9007199254740991n)
Boolean (true, false)
Undefined (let x; // x is undefined)
Null (let y = null;)
Symbol (Symbol('id'))

Q3: What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

Ans:null: It is an explicit absence of value. You manually assign null to a variable to indicate that it has no value.
    let x = null; // x is explicitly set to null

    undefined: It means a variable has been declared but not assigned any value
    let y; // y is undefined

Q4: Is JavaScript dynamically typed or statically typed? Explain.

Ans:- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language because you donâ€™t need to specify the data type of a variable when declaring it. The type is determined at runtime.

Q5: What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?

Ans:- 1. var

Can be redeclared and reassigned.
Function-scoped.
Can cause issues due to hoisting.

2. let

Cannot be redeclared but can be reassigned.
Block-scoped.

3. const

Cannot be redeclared or reassigned.
Must be initialized at declaration.

Q6: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Ans:- Hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved ("hoisted") to the top of their scope before the code executes. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.
