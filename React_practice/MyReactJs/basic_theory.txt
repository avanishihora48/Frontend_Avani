1. What is React.js?
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs), developed by Facebook. It helps create fast, dynamic, and reusable UI components.

2. Key Features:
-> Component-Based: UI is broken into reusable components.
-> Virtual DOM: Improves performance by updating only changed parts of the UI.
-> JSX (JavaScript XML): A syntax extension that looks like HTML inside JavaScript.
-> One-Way Data Binding: Data flows in one direction, making debugging easier.
-> State Management: Uses useState and useEffect hooks for handling component state.

3. Core Concepts:
🔹 Components: Reusable UI elements (function or class components).
🔹 Props: Data passed from parent to child components.
🔹 State: Internal component data that changes over time.
🔹 Hooks: Functions like useState and useEffect to manage state and side effects.

5. Why Use React?
✔️ Fast Rendering (Virtual DOM)
✔️ Reusable Components
✔️ Strong Community Support
✔️ Easy to Learn & Use

   manageable parts.

-> Types of Components:

🔹 Keeps the structure clean.
