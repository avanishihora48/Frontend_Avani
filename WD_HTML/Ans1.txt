Q1 : How to purchase domain?
Ans: To purchase a domain name, follow these steps:

1).Select a Domain Registrar:
   Choose a reputable domain registrar, such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains. These companies manage the reservation of domain names.

2).Search for Your Desired Domain Name: 
   Use the registrar's search tool to check if your preferred domain name is available. If it’s already taken, the registrar may suggest similar alternatives.

3).Choose Your Domain Name: 
   Select a domain that is short, memorable, and easy to spell. Aim for popular extensions like .com, but consider other options (e.g., .net, .org) if your first choice is unavailable.

4).Add the Domain to Your Cart: 
   Once you find an available domain, add it to your cart. Many registrars offer additional services, such as domain privacy protection (which keeps your contact information private) and web hosting.

5).Checkout and Payment: 
   Proceed to checkout, where you’ll enter your payment information. You can often choose to register the domain for multiple years for a discounted rate.

6).Configure Your Domain: 
   After purchasing, you can access your domain settings. Here, you can link the domain to a website hosting service, set up email addresses, and customize DNS settings as needed.
